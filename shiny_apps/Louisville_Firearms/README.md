#Firearm Incident Data

This app visualizes the firearm incident data from [Louisville's Open Data Portal](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/service/data).  Currently, the app:

* Shows Leaflet choropleth maps by zip code for where incidents have occurred, by year.
* Shows trending bargraphs for incidents, by year, for the years that have data.
