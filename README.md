Examining Louisville's Public Data

This project seeks to use some of Louisville KY's public data (http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/service/data) to show cool stuff.

Things done so far:

1. Shiny app built to show Building Permits by year.

2. Developed a model using the crime table:
	a. Pulled Medicare physician data from CMS
	b. Used ACS census data
	c. Modeled density of primary care physicians on the crime rate
	d. Got no results.  But will write about it!
	e. Wrote about this here: http://robertkahne.net/blog/index.php/2015/10/30/exploring-louisville-public-data-primary-care-physicians-and-crime-rates/
